## **Portfolio projects**

Here below I have briefly described the projects that I have worked on alongside the tech toolkit that were used during the process.

### [Analyzing international debt statistics](https://github.com/SuryaNageshBabu/International-debt-analysis-using-SQL/blob/main/README.md)

**Short synopsis**: In this project, the international debt data collected by the World Bank was used. The dataset contains information on the amount of debt owed by the countries. I have worked on this dataset with a primary focus of performing exploratory analysis by implementing various SQL aggregate, arithmetic functions and filtering techniques.
